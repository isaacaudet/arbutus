# Arbutus — What It Takes to Build This

> A plain-English breakdown of what's involved, what it costs, and what you'd be getting.

---

## What You've Seen Is a Demo

The working prototype you can access right now shows the core idea: search for a massage in Victoria, see real available slots, click through to book. That took a few days to build and proves the concept works.

Turning that into a real business — with actual providers signing up, real bookings going through, and a system that runs itself — is the next step. That's what this document covers.

## What Needs to Be Built

Think of it in three layers:

### The public-facing website
What patients see. This is largely done in the demo — search, browse providers, pick a slot, book. It needs some polish and to be connected to a real database, but the design and flow are there.

### The provider side
A private area where each practitioner can sign up, fill in their profile (photo, bio, hours), and connect their calendar. This is what makes the platform self-sustaining — providers manage themselves instead of you doing it manually.

### The admin side
A simple back-office for whoever runs Arbutus — to approve new providers, see how many bookings are happening, and handle any issues. Not patient-facing, just operational.

## How Long It Takes

For a developer working on this full-time: **3–5 weeks** to a version that's ready for real providers and real patients.

This isn't a six-month project. The core technology is well-understood, the design is mostly done, and modern tools make this faster than it used to be.

## What It Costs to Build

A project like this from a freelance developer in Canada typically runs **$8,000–$20,000** depending on who you hire and how experienced they are.

For this engagement specifically — given that the demo already exists and development can move quickly — you're looking at **$5,000–$8,000** for Phase 1 (everything needed to launch).

A reasonable payment structure:
- **50% upfront** to start work
- **50% on launch**

## What It Costs to Run (Monthly)

After it's built, the ongoing technical costs are very low:

| What | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Website hosting | Keeps the site online | ~$0–$20/mo |
| Database | Stores provider + booking data | ~$0–$25/mo |
| Email service | Sends booking confirmations | ~$0–$20/mo |
| Domain name | arbutus.ca or similar | ~$15/year |

**In the early days, this could run for almost nothing.** Costs only scale up as the business grows, and even at scale they stay small.

These are your costs — you'd have your own accounts for each of these services.

## What You'd Need From a Developer Ongoing

Building it is one engagement. After launch, you'll occasionally need:

- Bug fixes
- Small updates (new feature, design tweak)
- Technical support if something breaks

This is typically handled one of two ways:
- A small monthly retainer (e.g., $300–$500/mo for a few hours of availability)
- Or ad-hoc, billed by the hour when something comes up

Worth agreeing on upfront so there are no surprises.

---

## What You Own

Once the project is paid for, **you own everything** — the code, the design, the domain, the data. The developer has admin access to help maintain it, but the accounts and intellectual property are yours.

---

## What a Revenue Share Could Look Like

If the developer takes a reduced build fee in exchange for a small percentage of future revenue, here's what that might look like in practice:

- Build fee is reduced by $2,000–$3,000
- In exchange, developer receives ~5% of monthly revenue for a set number of years (or until bought out)
- As an example: if Arbutus brings in $5,000/month from provider subscriptions, the developer's share would be $250/month

This aligns incentives — they're motivated to build something that actually performs — and it reduces your upfront cost.

This only makes sense if you're planning to run this as an ongoing business, not a one-time project.

---

## What Makes This a Real Business

The technology is the easy part. What makes Arbutus work as a business is getting providers to sign up and keeping patients coming back.

The revenue model is simple: charge practitioners a monthly fee to be listed (similar to what they might pay for a directory listing or booking software add-on). Because Arbutus only shows up when they have an opening, there's a clear direct value — it fills slots that would otherwise sit empty.

A reasonable target:
- 20 paying providers at $49/month = ~$1,000/month
- 100 providers = ~$5,000/month
- The operating costs barely change as you grow

The margins are unusually high for a small business. Once the tech is built, most of what you earn goes straight to the bottom line.

---

## What You'd Need to Do (Non-Technical)

Building the software is the developer's job. What you'd be doing:

- **Sign up providers**: Call practitioners you know, get them listed, start with Victoria
- **Handle provider questions**: You're the face of the business
- **Set the pricing**: When to start charging, how much, what tiers
- **Marketing**: Getting patients to know Arbutus exists (social media, local press, word of mouth)
- **Business registration**: Register a business name, open a bank account, handle taxes

None of this requires a tech background. It's the part only you can do.
