# Arbutus — What It Is and How It Works for You

> Plain English. No tech stuff.

## The Problem You Already Know

You have a cancellation at 2pm on a Tuesday. You post it to Instagram. Maybe a few people see it. Maybe one books. Maybe no one does, and that hour goes to waste.

This happens to almost every practitioner. A last-minute opening is worth less than a planned one — but it's not worth nothing. It just doesn't have a good home.

## What Arbutus Does

Arbutus is a single place where people in Victoria can search for **same-day or next-day wellness appointments** across massage therapists, physiotherapists, and chiropractors.

They pick a service, pick a date, and see which practitioners have openings — sorted by soonest available.

They click a time, fill in their name and email, and the booking comes to you.

That's it.

## How It Knows Your Availability

You already have a booking system — Jane App, or a Google Calendar, or something similar. Those tools let you export a calendar link (it looks like a long web address ending in `.ics`).

You give Arbutus that link once. From then on, Arbutus checks it automatically and shows your real open slots to anyone searching. When you mark something as booked in Jane App, it disappears from Arbutus within minutes.

**You don't update two systems. You just use Jane App like you already do.**

## What a Booking Looks Like

1. A patient finds your open 3pm slot on Arbutus
2. They enter their name and email and confirm
3. You get an email: "New booking request — [Name], 3pm today"
4. You confirm it in Jane App (or click a link to accept)
5. The patient gets a confirmation email

Simple. No app to download, no account to create, for them or for you.

## What It Costs You

**Nothing to start.**

Arbutus is free during its launch period. We're working with a small group of Victoria practitioners to make sure it actually works before anyone pays a cent.

Eventually, there'll be a small monthly fee — similar to what you might pay for a Mailchimp account or a scheduling add-on. You'd only pay if it's filling slots for you.

There's no commission on bookings. You keep everything you earn.

---

## What You'd Need to Do

1. **Share your calendar link** — takes about 2 minutes inside Jane App or Google Calendar
2. **Fill out a short profile** — name, photo, bio, neighborhood, session length
3. **Respond to booking requests** — same as any other inquiry

That's genuinely it. No software to learn. No extra step in your daily workflow.

---

## What Arbutus Is Not

- It's not a replacement for Jane App. You keep running your practice exactly as you do now.
- It's not a review platform. Patients won't be rating you publicly (at least not to start).
- It's not another booking system to manage. Your Jane App calendar stays the source of truth.

## Why This Is Different From Posting on Instagram

When you post a last-minute opening on social media, you're hoping the right person sees it at the right moment. Most don't.

Arbutus flips it around: **the patient is already searching**. They want a massage today. They're ready to book. You show up because you have an opening at the right time — not because the algorithm decided to show your post.

## The Short Version

You have an open slot. Someone in Victoria wants exactly that. Arbutus introduces you.

If that sounds useful, reach out and we'll get you set up in under 10 minutes.
